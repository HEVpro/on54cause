# On Chain 4 Cause
This is a project made for the ETH Global Bangkok 2024. On Chain 4 Cause is a blockchain-based platform empowering people to support charities through sports and fundraising. Charities sign up, add events like marathons or triathlons, and individuals generate personalized fundraising links. If participants reach their goal (e.g., a â‚¬500 registration fee), the charity covers it, and all extra funds go to the cause. With blockchain transparency, charities also show exactly how donations are spent, ensuring every effort makes a real impact.

## Technologies
To develop our project, we used the following technologies:
* **Web3Auth**: account abstraction.
* **Chronicle**: fetching price for ERC20 tokens to update the donation equivalent in USD at a smart contract level.
* **NounsDAO**: brand assets have been used for the design of the project.
* **Circle**: USDC has been whitelisted for users to be able to donate using it.
* **Akave**: used to store website assets.
* **Blockscout**: smart contract verification and transaction explorer (only for Chiliz, as it is not available for Polygon Amoy)

## Chains
We deployed our smart contract to:
* Polygon Amoy ([here](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0xa4Bb9cee0fb14865B83245b403a6036049e3a9A6))
* Polygon zkEVM Cardona ([here](https://explorer-ui.cardona.zkevm-rpc.com/address/0xa4Bb9cee0fb14865B83245b403a6036049e3a9A6))
